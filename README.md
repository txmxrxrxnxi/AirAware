The challenge we are dealing with is Uncovering the Role of Greenhouse Gases in Your Neighborhood.

Human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions and natural systems that produce and absorb greenhouse gases (sources and sinks) interplay in a complicated manner to contribute to global climate change. As policymakers and citizens race to combat climate change, understanding this interplay is more important than ever. Your challenge is to use a combination of satellite and model-based datasets to map both human-caused and natural greenhouse gas emissions to enable better understanding of how these emissions contribute to a warmer world.
